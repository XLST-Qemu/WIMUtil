To use **WIMUtil**, follow these steps to launch PowerShell as an Administrator and run the installation script:

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator:**
   - **Windows 10/11**: Right-click on the **Start** button and select **Windows PowerShell (Admin)** or **Windows Terminal (Admin)**. </br> PowerShell will open in a new window.

2. **Confirm Administrator Privileges**: 
   - If prompted by the User Account Control (UAC), click **Yes** to allow PowerShell to run as an administrator.

3. **Paste and Run the Command**:
   - Copy the following command:
     ```powershell

   - Press **Enter** to execute the command.

This command will download and execute the **WIMUtil** script directly from GitHub.


## Application Overview üß©
Once launched, **WIMUtil** guides you through a four-part wizard:

1. **Select or Download Windows ISO**: Choose an existing ISO or download the latest Windows 10 or Windows 11 ISO from Microsoft.

2. **Add Answer File**:
   - Download and add the latest UnattendedWinstall Answer File.
   - Optionally, add a custom answer file `autounattend.xml` not `unattend.xml` manually.

3. **Extract and Add Drivers**:
   - Extract and add current device drivers to the installation media.
   - Add recommended Storage and Network drivers (Coming Soon).

4. **Create New ISO**:
   - Download the official `oscdimg.exe` from the WIMUtil repo if not already installed.
   - Select a save location for the ISO and create the file.

5. **Cleanup on Exit**: After creating your ISO, WIMUtil prompts to clean up the working directory. Selecting **Yes** is recommended to free up space.

## Using the Bootable ISO üñ•Ô∏è

Once your bootable ISO is created, it can be used to install Windows on a Virtual Machine or create a bootable USB flash drive. I recommend using [Ventoy](https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy). Here‚Äôs a quick guide:

- **Ventoy**
  - Download and Run `Ventoy2Disk.exe`.
  - Format your USB drive with Ventoy.
  - Simply copy the ISO to the USB drive.
  - Boot from the USB flash drive and choose your ISO.
  - Install Windows.
